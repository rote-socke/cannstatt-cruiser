# Architecture

Vite + TypeScript (strict) + Canvas 2D, with no game engine. Everything is drawn
into an offscreen buffer that is 180 view pixels high and 320-427 wide
(adaptive, see [View size](#view-size-adaptive-width)), and then presented with
integer nearest-neighbour scaling.

```

## Ownership

Every slice owns its directory (the ui slice also owns `src/net/`). Inside it the slice may create any files
(sprites, sub-modules, tests). It must keep `index.ts` exporting the factory
listed below. Slices **never** edit `src/main.ts`, `src/core/`, `src/types.ts`
or another slice's directory. If a contract change is needed, report it so the
foundation owner can extend it.

| Path | Owner | Factory / content | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/core/`, `src/types.ts`, `src/changelog.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `index.html`, configs, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md` | foundation | `startApp`, `Game` | loop, renderer, input, modes, RNG, bus, sprites, font, storage, test hook, playtest harness |
| `src/player/` | player | `createPlayerSystem()` | skater + longboard sprites and animations, jump physics (variable height, coyote, buffer), ducking, grind riding, crash/stumble anim, `state.player` incl. `hitbox` and `invulnerableTimer` |
| `src/world/` | world | `createWorldSystem()` | parallax zones (3-4 layers), the distance-driven zone route (see [Zones](#zones-the-distance-driven-route)), ground, foreground traffic (`state.trafficDensity`, the `vehiclePassed` event), window flags, `state.zoneIndex`, letterbox colour; the NorDIY scenery under `state.park` (read only) |
| `src/gameplay/` | gameplay | `createGameplaySystem()` | obstacles, people (with their items), rails, grindable bench, stars, joint (`state.entities`), spawner + clearability (jumps, ducks, grinds, moving people, chill jump, stomp bounce) and human margins around people, difficulty (`state.speed`), the chill effect (`state.chillTimer`), collisions, stomps, the tossed and the dropped items (`state.carriedItem`), score/combo/multiplier, health, gameplay events; stunt lines (`kicker`, `ledge`, events `launch` / `stuntStep` / `stuntEnd`, see [Stunt lines](#stunt-lines)), air trick scoring (`airTrick`); the NorDIY park line (`state.park`, the `highFiver`, events `highFive` / `sessionCheer` / `sessionEnd`, see [NorDIY skatepark](#nordiy-skatepark-roadmap-36)) |
| `src/ui/`, `src/net/` | ui | `createUiSystem()` | title, HUD (incl. chill and drunk timers), chill tint, drunk look, item button / chip, item and trick popups, pause (with the logo), game over, "Neu in dieser Version", the reload button, the install hint, "Zum Startbildschirm", highscore + star total persistence, mute + fullscreen buttons (hotspots, touch-sized on phones), portrait hint, the hidden settings menu and `state.kidMode` (load at startup, persistence); the online highscore list ("Bestenliste" screen, "Eintragen" after game over, `src/net/` client with offline queue, see [Online highscores](#online-highscores-roadmap-34)) |
| `src/audio/`, `public/`, `.github/` | audio/pwa | `createAudioSystem()` | WebAudio SFX from events (incl. the NorDIY park sounds, cheers and boombox loop by `state.park`), unlock via `onUserGesture`, mute persistence; manifest, pixel-art icons, service worker, GitHub Pages workflow |
| `server/` | server | Worker `fetch` (`server/src/index.ts`) | the highscore API (`GET /top`, `POST /score`), D1 schema, validation, word filter, rate limit, CORS; its own tests (`cd server && npx vitest run`) and deploy (`npx wrangler deploy`, by the orchestrator) |

PWA files that `index.html` and `app.ts` already reference (the PWA slice
creates them in `public/`):
- `manifest.webmanifest`
- `icons/icon-192.png`, `icons/icon-512.png`, `icons/apple-touch-icon.png`
- `sw.js` (registered only in production builds, and only once it is served as
  JavaScript)

### Update signal (ROADMAP item 15)

- `public/sw.js` posts `{type: 'updateReady'}` to every window
  (`clients.matchAll({type: 'window', includeUncontrolled: true})`) when a
  reload would start a newer, fully cached build:
  - the background page refresh stored a **changed** page (a new deploy)
    after all its assets were cached (`storePage`, never on the first install
    and never when an asset download fails, so the old build stays complete);
  - a new worker version activates and an older version's cache held a
    different page than the one it just cached (`dropOldCaches`).
- Core (`app.ts`, production only, same guard as the registration) listens on
  `navigator.serviceWorker` and passes `MessageEvent.data` to
  `handleServiceWorkerMessage` (`core/update.ts`), which sets
  `state.updateReady = true` for that message and ignores everything else.
- `state.updateReady` is never cleared (only a reload resets the page) and
  `resetRun` keeps it. The ui reads it to show the reload button (title,
  pause and game-over screens, never mid-run; see
  [Menu screens](#menu-screens-ui)) and calls `ctx.commands.reloadForUpdate()` from the
  hint's hotspot; core reloads the page (`location.reload()` through the
  `Platform`, a no-op in tests).
- **Re-check while open** (an installed app resumed from the background
  never starts again, so the worker's check on navigation never runs):
  `app.ts` `watchForUpdates(registration)` posts `CHECK_FOR_UPDATE_MESSAGE`
  (`{type: 'checkForUpdate'}`) to the controlling worker and calls
  `registration.update()` when the page becomes visible again
  (`visibilitychange`) and every `UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (5 min);
  `shouldCheckForUpdate(last, now, resumed)` skips a resume check within
  10 s of the last one. `sw.js` answers the message like the background
  refresh on navigation (`cacheShell`: re-fetch the page, cache its assets,
  post `updateReady` only for a changed, complete deploy); offline or failed
  checks are swallowed and keep the cached build.
- A message can be lost if the worker finishes before the loading page exists
  as a client; the next start then already runs the new build, so nothing is
  missed for long.
- Tests: `src/core/sw.test.ts` runs `public/sw.js` against in-memory caches,
  network and clients (also the `checkForUpdate` message, offline included);
  `src/core/update.test.ts` the check timing; `scripts/scenarios/update-hint.ts` checks it end to
  end on the preview build; `window.__game.simulateUpdateReady()` sets the
  flag without a deploy (docs/TESTING.md).

### Changelog ("Neu in dieser Version", ROADMAP item 16)

- `src/changelog.ts` holds `CHANGELOG: ChangelogEntry[]`, newest first, with
  `{version, date, items}`. `version` is `YYYY-MM-DD.n` (the deploy date and
  that day's build number, compared numerically by `compareVersions`), `date`
  its date part. `BUILD_VERSION` is the newest entry's version: the running build.
- **The orchestrator adds an entry for every deploy** (a new `.n` on the same
  day), before the deploy commit. Items are short German bullet points: at
  most `CHANGELOG_ITEM_MAX_CHARS` = 40 characters in game-font glyphs and
  `CHANGELOG_MAX_ITEMS_PER_ENTRY` = 6 per entry. Kid mode shows them too, so
  they never mention drugs or alcohol (`src/changelog.test.ts` checks all of this).
- At startup (Game constructor, before the systems' `init`) core reads the
  store key `lastSeenVersion` (`core/version.ts`):
  - nothing or junk stored (first visit): it stores `BUILD_VERSION` at once
    and `state.whatsNew` stays empty, so first-timers never see the screen;
  - otherwise `state.whatsNew = changesSince(lastSeen, CHANGELOG)`: the
    entries newer than the stored version, newest first, capped to
    `WHATS_NEW_MAX_ITEMS` = 6 items in total (entries left empty are dropped).
    Empty when the running build was already seen.
- The ui shows the screen while `state.whatsNew` is non-empty (before the
  normal title) and calls `ctx.commands.markVersionSeen()` when the player
  closes it: core stores `BUILD_VERSION` and empties `state.whatsNew`.
  `resetRun` keeps `whatsNew`.

### Install hint (ROADMAP item 18)

`state.install` (`InstallState`, `core/install.ts`), written by core only and
kept across runs:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `standalone` | already running installed: `matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)')` or `navigator.standalone` (iOS) |
| `platform` | `'ios'` (iPhone / iPad, also iPadOS with the Mac desktop user agent plus touch points), `'android'`, or `'other'` |
| `canPrompt` | a `beforeinstallprompt` was captured (Chromium) and not used yet: show the "Installieren" button |
| `installed` | the browser reported `appinstalled` during this visit |
| `visits` | page loads so far including this one (store key `visits`, +1 per load) |
| `dismissed` | the player closed the hint with "×" (store key `installHintDismissed`) |

- `app.ts` reads the environment through `Platform.installEnvironment()`
  (`detectInstallEnvironment` over user agent, touch points, display mode)
  and forwards the window events to `game.install` (`InstallController`):
  `beforeinstallprompt` -> `capturePrompt` (calls `preventDefault()`, keeps the
  event, `canPrompt = true`); `appinstalled` -> `appInstalled` (`installed = true`,
  `canPrompt = false`). Tests and headless games get `{standalone: false,
  platform: 'other'}` and a memory store.
- `ctx.commands.promptInstall()` shows the kept prompt (call it from a
  hotspot's `onPress`, it needs the user gesture) and clears `canPrompt`; a
  prompt can be shown only once, a refused one is swallowed.
  `ctx.commands.dismissInstallHint()` sets and persists `dismissed`.
- The ui decides when to show the hint: touch device, not `standalone`, not
  `installed`, not `dismissed`, `visits >= 2`, on title or game over only; a
  button when `canPrompt`, otherwise "Teilen -> Zum Home-Bildschirm" on `ios`.
- Tests: `src/core/install.test.ts`; `window.__game.simulateInstall({...})`
  and `promptsShown()` for playtests; `scripts/scenarios/version-install.ts`
  checks both contracts end to end (docs/TESTING.md).

## Contracts (src/types.ts)

### System

```ts
interface System {
  name: string;
  init?(ctx: GameContext): void;                       // once, at startup
  update?(ctx: GameContext, dt: number): void;         // every fixed tick (dt = 1/60), in EVERY mode
  render?: Partial<Record<RenderLayer, RenderFn>>;     // per frame, per layer
}
```

- **Update order** is the array order in `main.ts`: world, player, gameplay,
  audio, ui. Each tick runs as follows:
  1. Input snapshot. The pause key toggles pause and the mute key toggles mute.
  2. All `update`s run.
  3. Core integrates `time` and `distance += speed*dt` while playing, and ends
     the run when `health <= 0`.
  4. In title/gameover an action press starts a run. Core does this after the
     systems ran, so that press is not also a jump.
- `update` runs in every mode, so check `ctx.state.mode`. Gameplay physics
  should only advance while `mode === 'playing'`.
- **Render layers**, back to front: `background`, `world`, `entities`, `player`,
  `fx`, `ui`. Core clears the buffer to the letterbox colour before drawing.
  Always draw at integer coordinates. `RenderContext` is `{g, state, alpha,
  display, scroll, scrollLead}`; draw scrolling things from `r.scroll` /
  `r.scrollLead` (see [Frame loop](#frame-loop-and-smooth-scrolling)). Core
  reuses the same context object every frame: read it, never keep it.
- Always reach state through `ctx.state` / `r.state` and don't cache sub-objects,
  because `resetRun` replaces `state.player` and `state.entities` at every run start.

### GameContext

| Member | Use |
|---|---|
| `state` | the single mutable `GameState` |
| `bus` | typed event bus (`GameEvents`) |
| `rng` | seeded `Rng`, re-seeded with `state.seed` at every run start. Use it for all gameplay randomness (never `Math.random`), so test runs replay deterministically. |
| `input` | this tick's `InputFrame`: `action`, `duck` and `use` (each `{pressed, held, released, holdTime}`), `pausePressed`, `mutePressed`. See [Input](#input-action-duck-and-use). |
| `display` | `{portrait, touch, fullscreen, viewWidth, viewHeight}`. `viewWidth` is the current view width (320-427) and changes live; also on `RenderContext.display`. |
| `speedOverride` | speed forced by the test hook (`setSpeed`), or `null`. While set, core pins `state.speed`; difficulty code must not write it. |
| `commands` | `startRun, pause, resume, gameOver, toTitle, setMuted, setZone, toggleFullscreen, setLetterboxColor, useItem` (presses `use` for one tick), `reloadForUpdate` (reloads the page; see [Update signal](#update-signal-roadmap-item-15)), `markVersionSeen` (see [Changelog](#changelog-neu-in-dieser-version-roadmap-item-16)), `promptInstall`, `dismissInstallHint` (see [Install hint](#install-hint-roadmap-item-18)) |
| `addHotspot({rect, onPress})` | screen region (view px) that swallows pointer presses instead of jumping. `onPress` runs inside the DOM event, so fullscreen/audio APIs work there. Later hotspots win. Pass an `InputHotspot` (see below) for holds and keys. |
| `onUserGesture(fn)` | runs `fn` inside every DOM event of `USER_GESTURE_EVENTS` (`core/input.ts`: keydown, pointerdown, pointerup, touchend, click), registered before the input listeners. Phones grant user activation only at a touch's end, so the up events retry the WebAudio unlock (a context resumed in pointerdown can stay silent) |

### GameState field owners

| Field | Written by |
|---|---|
| `mode`, `modeTime`, `frame`, `time`, `distance`, `seed`, `muted` | core (via commands) |
| `updateReady` | core, from the service worker's `updateReady` message ([Update signal](#update-signal-roadmap-item-15)); kept across runs, the ui only reads it |
| `whatsNew` | core: at startup and on `commands.markVersionSeen()` ([Changelog](#changelog-neu-in-dieser-version-roadmap-item-16)); kept across runs |
| `install` | core: at startup, from the browser's install events and `commands.promptInstall` / `dismissInstallHint` ([Install hint](#install-hint-roadmap-item-18)); kept across runs |
| `speed`, `score`, `combo`, `multiplier`, `stars`, `health`, `entities`, `chillTimer`, `carriedItem`, `drunkTimer` | gameplay (`speed` is pinned by core while `ctx.speedOverride` is set; core zeroes `chillTimer` and `drunkTimer` at every run start; core reads `drunkTimer` for [drunk input](#drunk-input)) |
| `player.*` (position, velocity, grounded, grinding, grindTrick, airTrick, state, hitbox, invulnerableTimer) | player (gameplay changes grinding / crash only through the events it emits, and only reads `invulnerableTimer`, `grindTrick` and `airTrick`; see below and `src/player/CONTRACT.md`) |
| `zoneIndex` | world (and `commands.setZone`); `resetRun` sets `START_ZONE` |
| `park` | gameplay: the planned NorDIY park (`ParkPlan`), set once per Bad Cannstatt visit well before its start comes on screen and cleared (null) after its end has passed; core sets null at startup and `resetRun` clears it. World, audio and ui only read it (see [NorDIY skatepark](#nordiy-skatepark-roadmap-36)) |
| `trafficDensity` | world, every tick except while paused (during a run `LIGHT_TRAFFIC` 0.05 outside Mitte up to 1 in Mitte, 0 on the title and game over; see [Mitte traffic](#mitte-traffic)); audio reads it for the traffic noise |

Coordinates are screen space in view pixels, with y pointing down. The world
scrolls, while the player stays near `PLAYER_X`. `player.x/y` is the board's
contact point (y = `GROUND_Y` on the ground). Entities move left by
`speed * dt` per tick.

Collision handoff between player and gameplay: gameplay detects collisions
using `player.hitbox` and emits `crash` / `grindStart` / `grindEnd`. The player
system listens to these events to play the crash animation, or to snap onto
and ride the rail (gameplay passes the rail's entity id; the player reads its
rect from `state.entities`). The bench is grindable the same way: its entity
`y` (the backrest's top edge) is the rail top, see [Bench](#bench-ledge-contract).
A crash into a bin swallows the skater, see [Bin crash](#bin-crash). People (`vfbFan`,
`wasenGuest`) walk or sway: their entity `x` follows `data.ax` (the street
anchor) plus a motion that depends only on the distance to the player
(`gameplay/motion.ts`), and the collision box moves with them. Landing on a
person's head while falling is a stomp, not a crash (see
[Stomp and carried items](#stomp-and-carried-items)).

### InputHotspot (core/game.ts)

A core extension of the shared `Hotspot` for hold gestures and modal
screens. Every hook is optional; build it as a typed `const` and pass it to
`ctx.addHotspot`:

| Hook | Called |
|---|---|
| `onRelease()` | the pointer press this hotspot took ended (up, cancel, focus lost) |
| `onKeyDown(code)` | while `rect()` is non-null, every key press (`KeyboardEvent.code`) is offered to the hotspots, topmost first, before it reaches a button. Return true to take it: its button is not pressed, auto-repeats are ignored and the release goes to `onKeyUp`. |
| `onKeyUp(code)` | a key this hotspot took went up (or focus was lost) |

The ui slice uses it for the title and pause logo (long press by pointer or
K), for the open settings menu, which takes every key but M so nothing starts
a run behind it, for the modal "Neu in dieser Version" screen, and for the
menu buttons' keys (U = reload, T = "Zum Startbildschirm"; see
[Menu screens](#menu-screens-ui)). (Suggested later: move these hooks into `Hotspot` in `src/types.ts`.)

### Events (`GameEvents`)

| Event | Payload | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `runStarted` | `{seed}` | core |
| `gameOver` | `{score, stars, distance}` | core |
| `pause` / `resume` | `{}` | core |
| `mute` | `{muted}` | core (`commands.setMuted`, M key) |
| `zoneChanged` | `{index, previous}` | core (`commands.setZone`); world calls `setZone` when it advances |
| `jump` | `{velocity}` | player |
| `land` | `{impact, flipLeft?}` | player (`flipLeft`: ticks the running kickflip still needed on the touchdown tick, 0 or absent without one; gameplay judges the [bail](#air-trick) from it) |
| `grindStart` | `{entityId}` | gameplay |
| `grindEnd` | `{entityId, ticks}` | gameplay |
| `grindTrick` | `{entityId, ticks, points}` | gameplay (a [grind trick](#grind-trick) ended while still on the rail or bench) |
| `obstacleCleared` | `{entityId, kind, points}` | gameplay |
| `crash` | `{entityId, kind, health}` | gameplay (kind `'bin'`: the skater is stuck in the bin, see [Bin crash](#bin-crash); kind `'bail'` with `entityId` -1: a kickflip still turning on the landing, see [Air trick](#air-trick); the ui shows "Zu spät geflippt!" instead of "Autsch!", audio a board clatter) |
| `starCollected` | `{entityId, stars}` | gameplay |
| `chillStart` | `{entityId, duration}` | gameplay (joint, or bubble gum in kid mode, picked up; `state.chillTimer = duration`) |
| `stomp` | `{entityId, kind, item}` | gameplay (the falling skater landed on a person's head; the player bounces on the next tick) |
| `itemCaught` | `{item}` | gameplay (the tossed item reached the hands, or a [dropped item](#dropped-items) was picked up; `state.carriedItem = item`) |
| `itemUsed` | `{item, action}` | gameplay (use button with an item in hand; `action` is `'drink' \| 'eat' \| 'throw'`; clears `state.carriedItem`) |
| `drunkStart` | `{duration}` | gameplay (Maßkrug drunk; `state.drunkTimer = duration`) |
| `healthGained` | `{health}` | gameplay (Brezel / Lebkuchenherz eaten; the new health) |
| `ballThrown` | `{entityId}` | gameplay (the football left the hands as a `ball` entity) |
| `ballHit` | `{entityId, kind}` | gameplay (the thrown ball hit a person: the person's id and kind; the person's item drops onto the street) |
| `ballBack` | `{entityId}` | gameplay (a missed ball ricochets back towards the skater; the ball's id) |
| `scoreChanged` | `{score, delta, combo, multiplier}` | gameplay |
| `vehiclePassed` | `{kind, front, light}` | world, only while the mode is `playing` (a foreground vehicle's centre crossed `PLAYER_X`, once per vehicle, in every zone; `kind` car / van / bus / truck, `front` = front lane, `light` = set off as light traffic, density below 0.5). Audio plays the pass-by and, for light traffic, the swell (see [Light traffic](#light-traffic)) |
| `launch` | `{entityId, velocity}` | gameplay (the skater pressed jump in a kicker's launch window, never automatically, see [Manual ramp jump](#manual-ramp-jump-roadmap-40); the player takes off with `velocity` px/s upwards on the next tick, no hold, like the stomp bounce, replacing an ollie the same press started; jumpsim mirrors it) |
| `stuntStep` | `{step, steps, multiplier, points}` | gameplay (a further piece of a running stunt line was made: kicker air or ledge grind; the first piece made starts the line quietly, so the first `stuntStep` is the second piece at x2; `step` = the piece's place 2..`steps`, `multiplier` = pieces made in the attempt; the ui shows "Combo xN!", audio a rising sound) |
| `stuntEnd` | `{steps, made, completed, points}` | gameplay (a started attempt ended, exactly once: `completed` when the skater left the line's last piece with at least 2 pieces made, else he dropped out, never with a crash or lost health; `points` = line bonus, 0 if none; the ui shows "Stunt-Linie! +…" only when completed) |
| `airTrick` | `{ticks, points, full}` | gameplay (an [air trick](#air-trick) ended and the skater touched down cleanly: street landing or a grind start; `ticks` it ran; `full` false when the points were cut, a kickflip into empty air or a repeated one; the ui shows the big "Kickflip! +…" callout when full, else a plain "Kickflip +…" popup; audio the kickflip sting when full, else the plain trick sting) |
| `highFive` | `{entityId, points}` | gameplay (the use press inside a `highFiver`'s high five window; that press never uses the carried item; see [NorDIY skatepark](#nordiy-skatepark-roadmap-36)) |
| `sessionCheer` | `{level}` | gameplay (a grind trick, air trick or combo step inside the park; `level` 0..1 is the session's cheering so far; world animates the crowd, audio scales the cheers) |
| `sessionEnd` | `{level, points}` | gameplay (the skater left the park; `points` = the "Session!" bonus scaled by `level`, 0 if none; the ui shows the callout) |

Usage: `const off = ctx.bus.on('crash', (e) => ...)`. Subscribe in `init`.
Emitting is synchronous.

## Input: action, duck and use

`InputFrame` has three logical buttons with the same `ActionSnapshot` shape:

| Button | Sources |
|---|---|
| `action` | Space, ArrowUp, W, mouse button, touch tap / hold anywhere |
| `duck` | ArrowDown, S (held while the key is down); a swipe down on touch (held for `SWIPE_DUCK_TICKS` = 72 ticks, 1.2 s, or until the next tap turns into a jump; another swipe restarts it); the held jump finger dragged down in the air (a `TRICK_TAP_TICKS` tap, see [Kickflip drag](#kickflip-drag)); test hook `input.duck`. Held while grinding it is the [grind trick](#grind-trick); pressed in the air it is the [kickflip](#air-trick) |
| `use` | E (held while the key is down); `commands.useItem()`; test hook `input.use()` |

Inside a NorDIY high fiver's window the use press gives the high five
instead of using the carried item (see
[NorDIY skatepark](#nordiy-skatepark-roadmap-36), use routing priority).

Key hints for players: Space / ↑ / W jump, ↓ / S duck, **E use item**, P / Esc
pause, M mute.

**Use on touch and mouse:** pointers have no default for `use` (a tap
anywhere jumps). The ui shows an item button while `state.carriedItem` is set
(`ui/item-button.ts` `itemButtonRect`: in landscape under the HUD buttons,
top right; in portrait under the stats plate on the left, behind the skater,
so it never hides stars flying in from the right; the first-catch hint sits
beside it and pushes the popups below it, `popupCeiling`) and registers it as a hotspot whose `onPress` calls `ctx.commands.useItem()`.
That presses and releases `use` in one go, so the next tick sees
`use = {pressed: true, released: true, held: false}`, exactly like a tapped
key, and the pointer press never reaches the action. Systems react to
`input.use.pressed` only (no holds), so key and button behave the same:

```ts
const itemButton: Hotspot = {
  rect: () => (ctx.state.carriedItem && ctx.state.mode === 'playing' ? itemRect(ctx.display) : null),
  onPress: () => ctx.commands.useItem(),
};
ctx.addHotspot(itemButton);
```

### Drunk input

While `state.drunkTimer > 0` **and** the mode is `playing`, `core/drunk.ts`
holds back every press and release of `action` and `duck` by a random
`DRUNK_DELAY_MIN`..`DRUNK_DELAY_MAX` (8..20, ~130-330 ms) extra ticks and
wobbles every delayed press's hold (`core/config.ts`, tuning pinned by
`core/drunk-tuning.test.ts`):

- each edge draws its own delay, so the release delay alone stretches or
  shortens a hold by up to `MAX - MIN` ticks;
- **hold wobble** (ROADMAP 21): each delayed press also draws
  `-DRUNK_HOLD_WOBBLE..+DRUNK_HOLD_WOBBLE` (10) ticks; its release is
  delivered that much later / earlier, so a tap can become a high jump and a
  long hold a small one. The release never arrives before the press and a
  delayed press is always held at least 1 tick (no same-tick tap while
  drunk). A press that passes through sober (no delay) is never wobbled; a
  sober release of a press queued while drunk still gets that press's
  wobble;
- order per source is kept and no press is ever dropped;
- delays and wobbles come from a separate rng seeded from the run seed at
  every run start (per press: delay, then wobble; per release: delay), so
  runs replay deterministically and the gameplay rng (`ctx.rng`) is
  untouched;
- `use`, pause and mute are never delayed; focus loss and game over release
  everything at once and drop queued edges.

Gameplay's solver validates drunk patterns with
`drunkWindow(holdTicks)` → `{pressMin, pressMax, holdMin, holdMax}`: every
take-off from `pressMin` to `pressMax` ticks late with any hold in
`[holdMin, holdMax]` must clear the pattern, where the hold may change by
`DRUNK_DELAY_MAX - DRUNK_DELAY_MIN + DRUNK_HOLD_WOBBLE` (22) ticks either way
and `holdMin >= 1`. `drunkDelay(rng)` / `drunkHoldWobble(rng)` draw single
values for simulations. Under the hood `Game.buttons.action` / `.duck` are
`DelayedButton`s (same `press/release/releaseAll/tick` interface as
`ActionButton`; their `DelayClock` gives `frame()`, `delay()` and
`holdWobble()`, both 0 while sober), so tests and the test hook press them
as before.

`core/input.ts` maps DOM events through two DOM-free pieces that unit tests
drive directly: `keyDown/keyUp(game, code)` and `PointerControls`
(`down/move/up/cancel(id, viewX, viewY)`). The player decides what duck does
(on the ground only; jump wins over duck), see `src/player/CONTRACT.md`.

### Drunk look

Looks only (hitbox, jump and duck unchanged), never in kid mode (kid mode has
no beer), pure functions of the run time so replays look the same:

- **Player** (`player/wobble.ts` `drunkLook(drunkTimer, time)` →
  `DrunkLook {lean, stagger, flail, flailHigh, hiccup}`): the body leans
  `lean` = -2..2 px over the board, swaying slowly (one sway per 1.6 s);
  every 2.9 s a `stagger` lurches for 0.35 s to the full lean against the
  sway with a flailing arm; an arm flails up now and then and a hiccup
  bubble rises from the mouth.
- **UI** (`ui/drunk-look.ts`, drawn in `screens.ts`): strength eases in over
  `DRUNK_EASE_IN` (0.5 s) and out over the last `DRUNK_EASE_OUT` (1 s). Two
  faint double images of the frame sway against each other: one up to 6 px
  sideways (plus a little vertically, `GHOST_ALPHA` 0.36), a fainter second
  one (`SECOND_GHOST_ALPHA` 0.18) the other way; an amber wash pulses slowly
  (alpha 0.08 +- 0.05) and a soft vignette fades in from the side edges. The
  real image always shows through at more than half strength and the HUD is
  drawn after it (sharp), with a draining Maßkrug timer row.

### Touch: tap vs swipe down

A touch cannot be told apart from the start of a swipe when the finger lands,
yet a swipe down must never also jump. So a touch **during a run** stays
undecided for at most `SWIPE_WINDOW` = 5 ticks (~83 ms):

- the finger travels `SWIPE_DISTANCE` = 4 view px (straight-line distance,
  ~8 CSS px on a phone in landscape) roughly down, i.e. `|dx| <= dy *
  SWIPE_SLOPE` (1.2, up to ~50 degrees from vertical, so sloppy ~45 degree
  swipes count): duck, and this touch never presses the action;
- the finger lifts (a tap), or travels `SWIPE_DISTANCE` any other way
  (sideways / up): the action is pressed right then (a lifted tap arrives as
  press + release in the same tick = small ollie);
- the window runs out with the finger still down: the action is pressed and
  held from then on (hold = high jump).

Tradeoff: a touch jump during a run starts up to ~83 ms later than the finger
lands (a quick tap: when the finger lifts, which is usually sooner), and a
held touch counts its hold time from the decision. Keyboard and mouse presses,
and touches on the title, pause and game-over screens, are not delayed at all.
Hotspots still take presses first.

### Kickflip drag

On touch the kickflip (the [air trick](#air-trick)) needs no second finger:
the finger that holds the jump is dragged down while the skater is airborne
(`PointerControls`, private `dragTrick`):

- a touch whose action press is down remembers its finger position; a move
  of `SWIPE_DISTANCE` (4 view px) as steep as a swipe down (`SWIPE_SLOPE`)
  while `!player.grounded && !player.grinding` presses `duck` for
  `TRICK_TAP_TICKS` (3) ticks under its own source, without releasing the
  action, so the jump keeps its full height;
- on the ground or a rail, and on any upward move, the drag is measured
  afresh (no duck: a held finger that slides down on the street does
  nothing); after a trick the finger must move back up `SWIPE_DISTANCE` to
  re-arm;
- a separate swipe down (another finger, or a new touch) still works as
  before. Keyboard is unchanged: ↓ / S in the air.

## Frame loop and smooth scrolling

`app.ts` runs `FixedTimestep` (`loop.ts`) once per `requestAnimationFrame`:
0..n fixed 1/60 s ticks, then one render.

- **Vsync snapping:** rAF timestamps jitter around the display interval. Fed
  raw, an accumulator near a step boundary ran 0 updates in one frame and 2 in
  the next (measured: 8 % of frames at 60 Hz, a visible hitch). The loop
  estimates the display cadence (median of the last 15 frames, snapped to
  60 / 120 / 30 Hz within 4 %) and snaps each frame's elapsed time to a whole
  number of display frames when within 25 %. Result: exactly one tick per
  frame at 60 Hz, clean alternation at 120 Hz, even spreading at 144 Hz, and a
  missed vsync still catches up. Game time follows the display (a 59.94 Hz
  screen runs the game 0.1 % fast instead of hitching every 16 s).
- **Interpolated scroll:** `RenderContext.scroll` is `state.distance` plus
  `scrollLead = alpha * speed * TICK_DT` while playing (else 0), i.e. where
  the street is at the moment of the frame. Systems use `r.scroll` instead of
  `state.distance` for parallax / ground offsets and draw street-bound
  entities at `Math.round(e.x - r.scrollLead)`. At 60 Hz `alpha` is ~0 (no
  visible change); at 120/144 Hz and after a missed frame the street then moves
  in even steps instead of 0 / 3 px jumps. The player stays at its tick
  position (it does not scroll).
- **No per-frame allocation in core:** `Game.render` reuses one render
  context, `Sprite.draw` looks frames up by index (no key strings),
  `drawText` draws cached glyph canvases (one `drawImage` per character
  instead of one `fillRect` per font pixel). Keep slices allocation-free in
  render and update too: no template strings, spreads, `map`/`filter`,
  closures or object literals per frame in hot paths, and index loops
  (`for (let i = 0; ...)`) instead of `for-of`, which allocates an iterator.

## View size (adaptive width)

The view is always `VIEW_H` = 180 view pixels high. Its width adapts to the
screen so wide phones are filled instead of letterboxed:

- The scale is the largest integer device-pixel factor at which the minimum
  320x180 view fits. The width then becomes `floor(screenWidthDevicePx / scale)`,
  clamped to `VIEW_W` = 320 .. `VIEW_MAX_W` = 427 (about 21:9), so spare width
  is used whether the height or the width limits the scale. Leftover margins
  (under one view pixel, or beyond 21:9) stay letterboxed; the spare height of
  screens narrower than 16:9 stays letterboxed too. Examples: 1280x720 @1 ->
  scale 4, width 320; 1440x900 @1 -> scale 4, width 360; 1512x982 @2 -> scale
  9, width 336; 844x390 @3 (2532x1170 device px) -> scale 6, width 422;
  3440x1440 -> scale 8, width 427; portrait 390x844 @3 -> scale 3, width 390.
  Only a window smaller than 320x180 device px gets a fractional scale at 320.
- Core recomputes it on `resize`, `visualViewport` resize, `orientationchange`
  and `fullscreenchange`, resizes the buffer and updates `display.viewWidth`.
  There is no event: read `ctx.display.viewWidth` / `r.display.viewWidth`
  every tick or frame and never cache it.

Rules for every slice:

- **Never assume 320 wide.** Fill backgrounds, ground and overlays across
  `display.viewWidth`; tile parallax layers until `x >= viewWidth`.
- **Right-anchored UI** (pause/mute/fullscreen buttons, right-aligned HUD) is
  placed at `display.viewWidth - margin - w`, for both drawing and the hotspot
  rect (compute the rect inside `rect()`, not once at init). Centred text uses
  `Math.floor(viewWidth / 2)`. Content that must always be visible fits in the
  320 px minimum.
- **Spawn entities off the right edge** at `x >= display.viewWidth` (plus the
  entity width as margin), and despawn once `x + w < 0`. Because the visible
  width differs per device, spawning depends on it; keep spawn *timing* based on
  distance so difficulty is the same on every screen.
- Hotspots and pointer input use view pixels; core maps client coordinates
  with `screenToView` for any width.

## Modes

```
title --start--> playing --pause--> paused --resume--> playing
                 playing --die--> gameover --start--> playing
                 paused/gameover --toTitle--> title
```

Invalid commands are ignored. Restart taps on the game-over screen are ignored
for `GAMEOVER_INPUT_DELAY` (0.75 s). P/Escape pauses and resumes, and on the
game-over screen it goes back to the title. An action press (Space, ArrowUp,
W) also resumes from pause; core does it after the systems ran, so that press
is not also a jump (a tap on the pause screen resumes through a ui hotspot). Losing window focus (`blur`) or
hiding the page (`visibilitychange`) releases every button (action, duck, undecided touches) and pauses a running game.

## Drawing sprites

```ts
import { sprite } from '../core/sprite';

const BIN = sprite({ g: '#3d7a46', d: '#24502c', k: '#111' }, [`
  .gggg.
  gddddg
  gggggg
  gddddg
  .k..k.
`]);
BIN.draw(r.g, frameIndex, x, y, { flip: false }); // top-left at rounded (x, y)
```

- `.` and space are transparent. Every other character must be in the palette,
  otherwise parsing throws.
- Frames must all be the same size. A frame is a template literal or a
  `string[]`. Frames are rasterised once and cached, including flipped copies.
- Define sprites at module level, never per frame.

Text: `drawText(g, 'Grüße', x, y, { color, scale: 2, align: 'center', shadow: '#000' })`.
`y` is the top of the line, which is 8 font pixels tall: umlaut row,
capitals 1-5, descenders 6-7. Measure with `measureText`.

## Zones: the distance-driven route

Zone indices: 0 Stuttgart-Mitte, 1 Neckar, 2 Bad Cannstatt. The zones follow
each other along the street; there is no time-based cycle.
`src/world/zones.ts` holds the schedule (`ZoneRoute`):

- **Start:** every run (and the title screen) starts in `START_ZONE` = 2, Bad
  Cannstatt (`core/config.ts`; `resetRun` sets `state.zoneIndex` to it, the
  world snaps its route to it on `runStarted` and when returning to the title).
- **Route:** the route rides back and forth along the river, always to a
  neighbouring zone: `ROUTE_CYCLE` = `[2, 1, 0, 1]`, i.e. Cannstatt -> Neckar
  -> Mitte -> Neckar -> Cannstatt -> ... `ZoneRoute.zoneOf(k)` is the zone of
  leg k (leg 0 = the start zone, leg k begins at gateway k). A snap to the
  Neckar continues towards Mitte. Playtests use `new ZoneRoute().zoneOf(k)`
  instead of hard-coding the order.
- Every zone lasts `ZONE_LENGTH` (3584 px) of ground distance. The point where
  one zone hands over to the next is a **gateway** (a landmark), aligned to
  the paving grid (`SEAM_GRID`).
- **Gateways** are looked up by the zones they connect:
  `world/art/gateways.ts` `gatewayTable(depth)[from][to]` (depth 0 far, 1
  mid, 2 near). The reverse direction of a crossing uses the same art
  mirrored (`reversed()`), so the zone left behind stays on the left. Neckar
  -> Mitte has its own near gateway: the tunnel portal into the city.
- The next zone streams in through the gateway: near layers first, far
  layers last, each parallax layer at its own scroll factor, and the sky
  palette blends over `PALETTE_BLEND` px around the gateway.
- When the gateway reaches the player (`distance` passes the boundary), the
  world calls `commands.setZone(next)`, which sets `state.zoneIndex` and emits
  `zoneChanged`. So `zoneIndex` changes exactly at the gateway; a run start
  emits no `zoneChanged`.
- The first gateway is `ZONE_LENGTH` away from the start. Any other `setZone`
  (test hook, playtests) **snaps**: the world shows that zone at once and the
  next gateway is a full zone length further.
- Gameplay mirrors the route (a `ZoneRoute` it snaps on the same events) so it
  knows the zone at any street distance: people are themed by the zone their
  pattern lies in (VfB fans at the Neckar, zone 1; Wasen visitors in Bad
  Cannstatt, zone 2). Playtests import `ZONE_LENGTH` instead of hard-coding it.
- **Mombachquelle** (`world/art/mombach.ts`): background scenery on the far
  Neckar bank (mid layer), after the real place and without any sign or name:
  at the foot of a green embankment a basin of light grey boulders juts into
  the river; left of it a stair climbs the embankment and a bench stands on a
  flat area by the water; a second bench on a terrace above the basin, the
  spring water leaving a culvert below it in a jet that splashes into the
  basin; a bin hanging on a tree upper right. Soft mid-palette people chill
  on both benches and one has the feet in the basin (six frames: splash,
  kicking foot, wave). Never an obstacle.
- **Keeping a scene uncovered** (`world/scene.ts`, `world/stream.ts`): the
  near layer's lamps and trees scroll twice as fast as the Mombachquelle on
  the mid layer and would pass in front of the basin. A layer spec can name
  a part of an intro prop on the layer behind it that its props never cover:
  `LayerSpec.props.uncover = {id, from, to}` (prop-local x range; the Neckar
  near layer uses `{id: 'mombachquelle', ...MOMBACH_FOCUS}`, the flat area
  to the basin's right edge). Each `DepthLayer` gets the layer `behind` it
  (constructor argument); for every leg it asks that layer for the prop's
  layer x (`DepthLayer.introX(route, k, id)`, through `ZoneRoute.leg(depth,
  k)` and the leg's `PropStream.introX(id)`), converts the span to its own
  scroll factor (widened by up to `VIEW_MAX_W` so it holds for every view
  width) and calls `PropStream.keepClear(from, to)`: a prop that would
  overlap the span is placed right after it instead. So the basin is never
  covered while it is on screen, at any width.

### Mitte traffic

In Stuttgart-Mitte big, dense traffic drives on the foreground street, close
to the camera; everywhere else there is [light traffic](#light-traffic)
(`world/traffic.ts`, art in `world/art/traffic.ts`). Two lanes (`LANES`),
sharing one fixed vehicle pool, never allocating while driving:

- **Back lane** (`front: false`): hatchbacks, sedans and vans driving with the
  skater (they always overtake him). Drawn in the **world** layer
  (`drawBackTraffic`, after the street), so under every entity. No body ever
  reaches above `TRAFFIC_TOP` = `GROUND_Y + 2` (the riding line stays free).
- **Front lane** (`front: true`): oncoming traffic that adds city buses and
  trucks (`VEHICLES`: `heavy`), wheels below the view edge. Drawn in the
  **fx** layer (`drawFrontTraffic`), over gameplay, so it starts at
  `FRONT_TOP` = `GROUND_Y + 7`: below the deepest thing gameplay draws under
  the riding line (the curb gap, 6 px).
- **Exhaust clouds**: every vehicle puffs see-through clouds that rise and
  drift (`PUFF_LIFE` 3.2 s; buses and trucks puff big diesel clouds more
  often). They are drawn with the back lane (under gameplay) and may rise
  above the riding line, but never above `EXHAUST_TOP` = `GROUND_Y - 44`.
- **Rumble**: while a bus or truck is on screen the traffic lanes shake by
  1 px (`Traffic.shake`, 0 or 1, toggling every 4 ticks).
- **Headlight flashes**: each vehicle flashes its headlights (a honk, two
  short blinks) every 2.5-7 s.
- A smoggy haze goes over the far layers (the layers before the near one),
  scaled by `mitteShare(density)`: 0 at light traffic, 1 in Mitte, so the
  other zones stay clear.
- `traffic.test.ts` holds the limits; the playtest
  `scripts/scenarios/world.ts` checks them per vehicle / puff in a real run.

`trafficDensity(route, distance)` is `LIGHT_TRAFFIC` (0.05) away from Mitte
and 1 inside it, ramping in over `RAMP_LENGTH` (400 px) starting `RAMP_LEAD`
(160 px) before the Mitte gateway and out the same way after the gateway
that leaves it. The world draws traffic at that density on every screen
(also on the title and the game-over screen) but writes
`state.trafficDensity` only as the run sees it: the density while `playing`,
0 on the title and game over (paused keeps the last value). No other slice
writes it. `WorldSystem.trafficDensity()` and
`window.__world.trafficDensity()` return the drawn density. Test hook:
`window.__world` (`world/debug.ts`, see docs/TESTING.md).

#### Light traffic

Below density `DENSE_FROM` (0.2), i.e. in Neckar and Bad Cannstatt, the
street has light traffic: one vehicle at a time. Once the street has been
empty for 4-11 s (`LIGHT_GAP`, from the traffic rng) a single vehicle enters
a random lane, drawn from that lane's `Lane.lightKinds` bag: hatchbacks,
sedans and vans, no trucks, and a bus only now and then in the front lane.
The next one waits until it has left the screen. Same drawing, limits and
layers as in Mitte, so it never covers the skater or obstacles; at density
`>= DENSE_FROM` every lane runs on its own timer (`Lane.kinds`,
`Lane.interval`).

**Pass-bys** (`vehiclePassed`): `Traffic.update(dt, scroll, density,
viewWidth, onPass?)` calls `onPass` once per vehicle when its centre crosses
`PLAYER_X` (`reportPasses`, after moving). The listener gets one reused
`VehiclePass` object (copy what you keep); the world passes a listener that
emits `vehiclePassed` with a copy **only while the mode is `playing`** (none
on the title, pause or game over, although traffic is drawn there). Each
vehicle remembers whether it was set off as light traffic (`light`, density
below `LIGHT_BELOW` 0.5 at launch) and whether it `passed`.

**Traffic audio** (`audio/traffic.ts` `TrafficNoise`, `audio/passby.ts`
`PassBy`, `audio/sounds.ts` `TRAFFIC_RUMBLE`): a layered rumble on one gain
bus (lowpassed road noise whose cutoff opens with the level, tyre hiss and a
throbbing engine drone of two detuned low saws).

- **Steady hum** only in and around Mitte: `humLevel(density)` maps the
  density above `LIGHT_TRAFFIC` to 0..1 (`TRAFFIC.humCurve`), so light
  traffic (0.05) has **no steady hum** and Mitte plays at full level.
- **Light-traffic swells**: on each `vehiclePassed` with `light`,
  `TrafficNoise.swell(strength, time)` (strength `PASS_BY.lane`: front 1,
  back 0.6) lets the rumble rise for `TRAFFIC.swell.rise` (0.25 s) and fade
  out by `length` (1.2 s) at up to `peak` (0.35); up to `voices` (4)
  overlapping vehicles are summed (fixed slots, no allocation). The street
  outside Mitte is silent between vehicles.
- **Pass-by whoosh** (`PassBy.pass`): a cue per vehicle kind (`passCar`,
  `passVan`, `passBus`, `passTruck`), louder for the front lane; in dense
  Mitte traffic quieter (`dense` 0.4) and at most one per second, in light
  traffic every vehicle (at least `lightGap` 0.12 s apart). Ducked like the
  rumble.
- Everything is silent unless playing and unmuted; the rumble dips to
  `duckTo` (0.45) for ~8 ticks whenever a gameplay sound plays, then glides
  back (traffic sounds never duck it).
- One-shot cues are rng-free (a hash of the run-time slot), so they only
  sound in and around Mitte: horns from density 0.5 (`honk` car,
  `honkShort` small-car double beep, `hornDeep` bus / truck; at most one per
  1.5 s slot) and a passing truck (`truckPass`, from density 0.6, at most
  one per 6 s slot).
- `window.__audio.log` records `traffic:start` / `traffic:stop` whenever the
  backend starts or stops hearing any rumble or swell (`TrafficNoise.sounding`):
  in light traffic that is once per passing vehicle, in Mitte once on the way
  in and out; plus the cues.

### Flags

Two small flags hang from a window sill of a mid-layer house
(`world/art/flags.ts`): a Palestine flag on a Fachwerk house in Bad
Cannstatt (`fachwerkAFlag`, `CANNSTATT_FLAG_X`) and a trans pride flag on
the tall Mitte terrace (`housesBFlag`, `MITTE_FLAG_X`).

- **Hanging vertically**: a `FlagSpec` is the flag turned 90 degrees
  clockwise, hoist edge on top at the sill, stripes running vertically
  (`stripes` left to right, the Palestine triangle pointing down from the
  hoist). Four pre-rendered flutter frames (`FLAG_FRAMES`, 2 fps) with a 1 px
  drape and a wandering shaded fold row, plus a soft wall shadow; nothing is
  allocated per frame. The flag logic (`flagColor`, `drapeShift`,
  `foldRow`) is pure and unit-tested.
- **Once per zone visit**: `withFlag(house, houseH, flag, dx, top)` returns
  a `Prop` with `flag` set to the flag's name. The flagged house is only in
  its layer's stream `intro`, never in the fillers or landmarks (those use
  the plain house), so each flag shows once per visit of its zone.
- **Never covered**: the near layer of the zone keeps the flag clear with
  `LayerSpec.props.uncover = {id, ...flagSpan(flag, dx)}` (the flag, its
  sway and wall shadow in house-local x), the same mechanism as the
  Mombachquelle, so the street props (Litfaßsäule, lamps, trees) never pass in
  front of it.
- Tests: `world/art/flags.test.ts`, `world/art/flags-placement.test.ts`.

## Menu screens (ui)

The ui draws four menu screens; `ui/menu-state.ts` `menuScreen(state, view)`
picks one (null while riding or while the settings menu covers it):

| Screen | When | Buttons (key) |
|---|---|---|
| "Neu in dieser Version" | mode `title` and `state.whatsNew` non-empty, before the normal title | "Weiter"; modal: a tap anywhere or any key but M closes it too (`commands.markVersionSeen()`) |
| title | mode `title` | reload, install hint, trophy "Bestenliste" (B, see [Online highscores](#online-highscores-roadmap-34)); the logo's long press opens the settings |
| pause | mode `paused` | the logo (long press = settings, a short tap resumes), "Zum Startbildschirm" (T), reload |
| game over | mode `gameover`; buttons only after `GAMEOVER_INPUT_DELAY` (0.75 s) | "Eintragen" (E / Enter, only when the run makes the online top 20), "Zum Startbildschirm" (T), reload, install hint |

- **Reload** (`notices.ts` `reloadOffered`): a card "Neue Version da" with
  the button "Neu laden" (desktop label "Neu laden (U)") while
  `state.updateReady` and the mode is not `playing`; it calls
  `commands.reloadForUpdate()`. A real button because the installed app
  (standalone) has no browser reload.
- **"Zum Startbildschirm"** (desktop label with "(T)"): ends the run and
  shows the title (`commands.toTitle()`). From the pause screen the
  unfinished run still counts: its score and stars go into the highscore and
  star total first (`recordRun`, saved at once). On game over it was already
  recorded. Escape on game over also goes to the title (core).
- **Install hint** (`notices.ts` `installHintKind(install, touch)`): touch
  devices only, not `standalone`, not `installed`, not `dismissed` and from
  the first visit on (`INSTALL_HINT_MIN_VISITS` = 1); on title and game
  over, never in pause or mid-run. Kind `'prompt'` when `canPrompt` (text
  "Als App: Vollbild und offline", button "Installieren" calling
  `commands.promptInstall()` inside the tap), otherwise `'ios'` on iOS
  ("Teilen" with the share icon, arrow, "Zum Home-Bildschirm"); other
  platforms without a captured prompt get none. "×" calls
  `commands.dismissInstallHint()`. On game over the prompt kind shows as a
  **compact card** (`InstallCard` `'compact'`: just the button "App
  installieren" and "×"); on a crowded game over it goes before the stars
  and distance rows. The title keeps the full card.
- **"Neu in dieser Version"**: a headline and one bullet line per item of
  `state.whatsNew` (`whatsNewLines`, newest first; core caps them to
  `WHATS_NEW_MAX_ITEMS`).
- **Layout**: `ui/menu-layout.ts` has one pure function per screen
  (`titleLayout`, `pauseLayout`, `gameOverLayout`, `whatsNewLayout`)
  returning `MenuLayout {blocks, buttons, panel}`; `currentMenu(r, view)`
  computes the one showing (`MenuLayout.install` says which install card
  kind was placed). The title's opaque panel starts at `TITLE_PANEL_Y` (64)
  with `PANEL_PAD` on all four sides. The hotspots (`index.ts`) and the drawing
  (`menu-screens.ts`) use the same rects, so what is drawn is what can be
  tapped. `ui/column.ts` `fitColumn` stacks the blocks centred between a
  top and a bottom and drops optional ones (highest `drop` level first, all blocks of that level at once) until the
  rest fits, so every screen works at 320-427 px wide, in portrait and with
  44 px touch buttons; nothing overlaps the HUD button row.

## Settings menu and kid mode

- `state.kidMode` is **on by default** (ROADMAP 39): `createInitialState`
  sets it true, and it is kept across runs by `resetRun`. The ui loads it in
  `init` (`store` key `kidMode`, `loadKidMode`): only a stored `false`, an
  explicit choice in the hidden settings, turns it off; missing or junk
  storage means kid mode. Every change in the menu is saved at once, so an
  explicit choice (off or on) is kept across reloads. Other slices only read
  it.
- Kid mode is invisible to players (ROADMAP 38): the title and the HUD show
  no "Kindermodus" badge or chip; only the hidden settings menu shows the
  switch.
- The menu "Einstellungen" has no visible button. It opens on the title
  and on the pause screen after holding the logo (`logoRect` on the title,
  `MenuButtons.logo` on the pause screen; touch or mouse) or K for
  `LONG_PRESS_TIME` = 3 s; a thin progress bar under the logo shows only
  after `LONG_PRESS_HINT_DELAY` = 1 s. Letting go of the logo earlier is a
  normal tap: it starts the run (title) or resumes (pause); K alone never
  does either. The menu is drawn over the title or pause screen (core modes
  are unchanged) and swallows all taps and keys but M.
- Switching kid mode from the pause screen restarts the run (once switched,
  the menu notes "Lauf wird neu gestartet"): kid mode changes the art of
  things already on the street, so when the menu closes with kid mode
  switched, the ui ends the paused run like "Zum Startbildschirm" (its score
  and stars count for the highscore and star total) and starts a new run.
- The Kindermodus button switches kid mode on **and off at once**; the 3 s
  long press is the only guard (the parent check was removed in Wave 9).
  Zurück and Escape close the menu. Keys: Enter / Space toggles.
  `SettingsMenu.screen` is `'closed' | 'menu'`.
- Logic in `ui/settings.ts` (DOM-free: `LongPress`, `SettingsMenu`,
  `loadKidMode` / `saveKidMode`), layout in `ui/layout.ts` (`settingsLayout`
  → `{toggle, back}`), drawing in `ui/screens.ts`; the pause
  logo's rect comes from `ui/menu-layout.ts` (`pauseLayout`).
- What kid mode changes: gameplay draws the joint entity as a pink bubble
  gum (`chillPickupArt`), the ui shows the gum HUD icon, a sweet pink tint and
  the popup "Kaugummi!" (`ui/chill-look.ts`); player and audio pick their own
  kid-mode look and sounds. No text, popup or art in kid mode refers to drugs.
  The effect's mechanics (timer, slowdown, lower jump) are identical.

### Tap sizes (ui/layout.ts `uiMetrics`)

| Display | HUD tap area / plate | Menu button height | ~CSS px per view px |
|---|---|---|---|
| desktop (no touch) | 14 / 14 | 18 | 4 |
| touch, landscape | 24 / 22, icons 2x | 24 | 2 |
| touch, portrait | 44 / 22, icons 2x | 44 | 1 |

So every tap area on a phone is >= ~44 CSS px; the HUD tap areas stay right
of x = 120 (clear of the stats plate) at every width from 320 to 427.
The pause button exists only during a run (`layout.ts` `riding`); on the
title and game-over screens mute and fullscreen move flush right into its slot.
All UI plates (HUD, buttons, zone banner, pause prompt, panels) are opaque.

### Popups (ui/popups.ts)

At most 3 popups show at once. A repeat of a live popup merges into it
("Stern! x3"). Events of one tick are collected by `ui/popup-feed.ts` and
flushed once per tick, so events that belong together become one popup:
a stomp with the points of its `obstacleCleared` "Stomp! +150" (a ball hit
"Treffer!", merged the same way with an `obstacleCleared` of the same person;
`ball.ts` scores through `addPoints` only, so it shows without points),
eating "Lecker! +1" with a heart (or "Lecker! +…" with the bonus at full
health), "Prost! Gluck gluck gluck" (never in kid mode), "Wurf!",
"Achtung, der Ball!" on a ricochet, "Autsch!" on a crash and
"Grind-Trick! +…". No popup rises above the HUD stats plate (`PopupPool.ceiling`;
stacks then grow downwards). Every popup has a 1 px ink outline; catch popups
and all popups in portrait are drawn at scale 2 (`popupScale`). The ui slice
shows "Stomp!" on `stomp`; gameplay adds the points.

## Online highscores (ROADMAP 34)

A public top-20 list ("Bestenliste") shared by all players. Not cheat-proof
(the game runs on the client); the server only stops absurd entries, which is
enough for friends and family.

### Server (`server/`, owned by the server slice)

- A Cloudflare Worker with a D1 database (free plan), live at
  `https://cannstatt-cruiser-scores.rote-socke.workers.dev`. Self-contained:
  own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and Vitest tests; the root build and
  `npm test` ignore the folder. Layout, local dev, deploy steps and the full
  API contract: [server/README.md](../server/README.md). Deploys
  (`npx wrangler deploy`) are done by the orchestrator.
- **API** (JSON, CORS for `https://rote-socke.github.io` and
  `http://localhost:*` / `http://127.0.0.1:*`):
  - `GET /top` -> `200 {entries: [{rank, name, score, distance, date}]}`, top
    20 by score (a tie goes to the earlier entry), cached 30 s.
  - `POST /score` with `{name, score, distance, duration, version, device}`
    -> `200 {ok: true, rank, entries}` (`rank` 1-based or `null` outside the
    top 20), `400 bad-request`, `422 name`, `422 implausible`, `429 rate`.
  - `distance` is in metres (game px / 10), `duration` in whole seconds of
    play, `version` the build string (`BUILD_VERSION`), `device` a random id
    kept per install (8-64 of `A-Z a-z 0-9 -`).
- **Protection**, in `server/src/`:
  - `submission.ts` checks shape first (integers, body <= 2 KB), then the
    name, then plausibility;
  - `name.ts` + `word-filter.ts`: 2-16 chars after trimming, letters incl.
    äöüß, digits, space, `-_.`, plus a word filter;
  - `rate-limit.ts`: one accepted run per device per 20 s, 50 per rolling day;
  - `plausibility.ts`: see below;
  - `store.ts` / `ranking.ts`: only the best 500 runs are kept.
- **Privacy**: stored per run are name, score, distance, duration, version,
  date and the SHA-256 hash of the device id. No IP address, no headers.
- **Plausibility bounds are tied to the game's tuning.** `plausibility.ts`
  hard-codes `MAX_SPEED_M_PER_S = 190 / 10`, which is `TOP_SPEED`
  (`src/gameplay/difficulty.ts`) over `PX_PER_METRE` (`src/ui/layout.ts`),
  with a 10 % margin; and point rates (`MAX_POINTS_PER_METRE`,
  `MAX_POINTS_PER_SECOND`, `SCORE_ALLOWANCE`) sized from the point constants
  (`catalogue.ts` obstacle points and `MAX_MULTIPLIER`, `ITEM_POINTS`,
  `AIR_TRICK_POINTS`, `STUNT_MAX_MULTIPLIER` / `STUNT_LINE_BONUS`,
  `SESSION_MAX_POINTS`, ...). **A change that makes the game faster, changes
  `PX_PER_METRE` or gives more points must update `server/src/plausibility.ts`
  (and its tests) and redeploy the worker**, otherwise real runs come back as
  `422 implausible`. The server does not import from `src/`, so nothing
  catches this automatically.

### Client (`src/net/` + `src/ui/`, owned by the ui slice)

Placement approved by the user (ROADMAP 34):

- **Title**: a trophy button in the top-right button row (key B) opens the
  "Bestenliste" screen: the top 20 (scrollable on phones), an offline note
  instead of the list when there is no connection, and a short privacy note.
- **Game over**: an "Eintragen" button only when the score would reach the
  top 20 (compared with the last fetched list). It leads to a name entry
  (on-screen keyboard on touch); in kid mode only generated nicknames such as
  "Flinker Fuchs 42" can be picked, no free text. The remembered name makes
  later entries one tap. Afterwards the list shows with the own entry
  highlighted.
- Nothing in the pause menu.
- `src/net/`: a small network module that talks to the worker (`GET /top`,
  `POST /score`) and keeps an **offline queue**: an entry made offline is
  stored and sent later. It takes `fetch` and the store as parameters so unit
  tests use a fake fetch and a memory store.

Modules:

| Module | Content |
|---|---|
| `net/api.ts` | `ScoresApi(fetch, {baseUrl, timeoutMs})`: `top()` / `submit(run)`; `SCORES_URL` (the live worker), `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (6 s, then it counts as offline). Never throws: failures map to `ScoreError` `'offline' \| 'name' \| 'implausible' \| 'rate' \| 'bad-request' \| 'server'`. Answers are validated (`parseEntries`) |
| `net/payload.ts` | `scorePayload(run, name, version, device)`: `RunStats {score, distance (px), seconds}` -> the POST body (integers, metres via `PX_PER_METRE` from `ui/layout.ts`, duration >= 1 s) |
| `net/device.ts` | `loadDeviceId(store)`: random id (`crypto.randomUUID` or random hex), store key `deviceId` |
| `net/queue.ts` | `ScoreQueue`: the offline queue, store key `pendingScore`, keeps only the best pending run; `SEND_SPACING_MS` 20 s (the server's rate limit) |
| `net/service.ts` | `ScoreService`: `top` (last fetched list) and `topState` (`'idle' \| 'loading' \| 'ready' \| 'offline'`), `refreshTop()`, `submit(run, name)` -> `SubmitOutcome` (`ok` with rank / `queued` offline or on a server error / `failed` name, implausible, rate, bad-request), `retryPending()` (spaced by `SEND_SPACING_MS`). Clock, `online()`, timers, store and api are injected |
| `net/browser.ts` | `createBrowserScoreService(store)`: real `fetch`, `navigator.onLine`, `BUILD_VERSION`; retries the queue on `online` and when the page becomes visible |
| `ui/score-rules.ts` | `TOP_SIZE` 20, `qualifies(score, top)` (beats the 20th, or any score > 0 while the list is short or unknown), the client copy of the server's name rules (`nameProblem`, `cleanName`, `stripNameInput`), remembered name (store keys `scoreName`, kid mode `scoreKidName`), last entry (`scoreLastEntry`) and `ownRank` for the highlight |
| `ui/nicknames.ts` | kid-mode nicknames "Adjektiv Tier NN" (all <= 16 chars, numbers with a bad meaning skipped; the test checks every combination against the rules) |
| `ui/highscore-flow.ts` | `HighscoreFlow`: DOM-free state machine (`screen` `'closed' \| 'list' \| 'entry'`), `SCORE_TEXT` (all German texts incl. the privacy note), `offered`, `openList()`, `openEntry(kid)`, `setName`, `reroll` (kid mode "Neuer Name"), `submit()`, scroll. A run start fetches the list in the background so `offered` is known at game over |
| `ui/score-layout.ts` / `ui/score-screens.ts` | pure layouts (title trophy left of mute / fullscreen, moved below the row where it would touch the logo; list rows and scroll; entry field and buttons) and their drawing |
| `ui/name-field.ts` | the native `<input>` over the drawn field in adult mode, so phones open their own keyboard; its key and touch events stop there and never reach the game |
| `ui/list-scroll.ts` | drag and wheel scrolling of the list (arrow keys scroll in `index.ts`) |

- **Options** (`UiSystemOptions` in `ui/index.ts`): `createUiSystem({store,
  scores, nameField})`. `scores` defaults to the browser service
  (`createBrowserScoreService`) in a browser and to `null` elsewhere;
  `nameField` defaults to the DOM input (`createDomNameField`) in a browser
  when there is an online list. Passing `null` turns the part off: `scores:
  null` means no trophy, no "Eintragen", no network at all; `nameField: null`
  means no native input (typing then goes nowhere; kid mode never needs it).
  Tests pass a fake `ScoreServiceLike` and a fake `NameField`, never the
  real network. The returned `UiSystem` exposes `highscores` (the
  `HighscoreFlow`, null without an online list).
- **Store keys** (the game's `Store`, namespace `cannstatt-cruiser:`):
  | Key | Owner | Content |
  |---|---|---|
  | `deviceId` | `net/device.ts` | the random install id sent as `device` |
  | `pendingScore` | `net/queue.ts` | the best run waiting to be sent (`null` when empty) |
  | `scoreName` | `ui/score-rules.ts` | the remembered free-text name (adult mode) |
  | `scoreKidName` | `ui/score-rules.ts` | the remembered nickname (kid mode), kept apart so no free text shows in kid mode |
  | `scoreLastEntry` | `ui/score-rules.ts` | `{name, score}` of the last entry sent, for the highlighted own row (`ownRank`) |
- **Keys** (a highscore screen takes every key but M, so nothing starts a
  run behind it): B opens the list on the title; on the list B or Esc
  closes it, ↑ / ↓ (and W / S) scroll one row per press and keep scrolling
  while held (`LIST_KEY_ROWS_PER_SECOND` = 10 rows per second), PageUp / PageDown scroll a page;
  "Eintragen" on game over is E or Enter; in the entry Enter sends, Esc goes
  back, N picks a new nickname in kid mode, and in adult mode any other key
  focuses the native input.
- **Native input overlay** (`ui/name-field.ts`, adult mode only): an HTML
  `<input>` (max `NAME_MAX` chars, `enterkeyhint="send"`, no autocorrect)
  that `index.ts` places every tick over the drawn name field
  (`scoreEntryLayout(...).field`, scaled from view px to the canvas' CSS
  box; font >= 16 CSS px so iOS does not zoom) and hides and blurs as soon
  as the entry closes, kid mode is on or the portrait rotate hint covers the
  game. Its keydown, pointer and touch events stop at the input, so letters
  such as E, W, S, P, M or Space never reach the game; key releases still
  bubble, so no game key stays held. Enter in it sends, Esc closes the
  entry, every input event calls `flow.setName`. "Eintragen" focuses it
  inside the tap or key press (so phones open their keyboard): on desktop
  always, on a phone only without a remembered name (with one, "Als <Name>
  eintragen" is a single tap); tapping the drawn field focuses it too.
- Kid mode never shows a text input: the entry offers the remembered or a
  generated nickname and "Neuer Name".
- `window.__ui.highscores()` reports the flow's state and tap areas for
  playtests (docs/TESTING.md).
- The server's name rules are duplicated in `ui/score-rules.ts` (to catch a
  bad name before sending); change both together.

## Stomp and carried items

Contract between gameplay, player, ui and audio (types in `src/types.ts`,
`STOMP_BOUNCE_VELOCITY` in `player/tuning.ts`):

- **Detection** (gameplay, `stomp.ts` `stompPeople`, rule `landsOnHead` in
  `rules.ts` shared with the solver): the player is not supported, falls
  (`vy > 0`), its feet (`player.y`) are within `STOMP_DEPTH` (8 px) below the
  top of the person's collision box (head and shoulders) and its hitbox
  overlaps that box widened on both sides by `stompReach(step)` =
  `max(4, (16 * step - HITBOX_W - head w) / 2)` (`step` = scroll px per tick,
  `STOMP_SPAN_TICKS` 16). The reach grows with the speed, so the stomp window
  stays ~15 take-off ticks (full hold) at every speed (`stomp-ease.test.ts`).
  A person counts as passed (`obstacleCleared`, `contacts.ts`) only once it
  is beyond that reach behind the skater, so it can be stomped until then.
  Checked after rail landings and before the crash check, never while the
  player is in the crash animation. Touching a person from the side lower
  down, or rising into one, is still a crash.
- **Stomp** (gameplay): the person becomes `done` (harmless), stops moving
  (`data.walk`/`sway` 0, anchored where it is) and gets `data.stompedAt =
  state.time`; people-art draws it tumbling onto its back (0.35 s), sitting
  up dazed with circling stars, then laughing. The stomp counts as a trick
  (`addTrick` with the person's points) and gameplay emits `stomp {entityId,
  kind, item}`. The item comes from `items.ts`: fans a football; Wasen
  visitors by `data.prop` a Maßkrug (`beer`; in kid mode `gingerbread`) or a
  Brezel (`pretzel`), so kid mode never yields beer. People carry their item
  visibly before the stomp.
- **Bounce** (player): on the next tick `vy = -STOMP_BOUNCE_VELOCITY`, like a
  take-off with the action already released (no hold gravity); jumpsim
  mirrors it (`stompBody`, checked against the real player in
  `jumpsim.test.ts`).
- **Toss** (gameplay, `toss.ts`): the item flies from the head in a ballistic
  arc aimed at the hands' position at launch (`x + 3`, half the hitbox
  height up) and, after 55 % of `TOSS_TIME` (0.45 s), eases onto the hands'
  current position, so it is always caught, also when the skater jumps or
  ducks. A Maßkrug spills foam drops. On arrival gameplay sets
  `state.carriedItem`, adds `ITEM_POINTS` and emits `itemCaught {item}`.
- **Losing it**: a crash clears `state.carriedItem` (`health.ts`) and cancels
  an item in flight; `resetRun` clears it at every run start.
- **Dropping it** (someone else's item): a ball hit knocks the person's item
  onto the street, see [Dropped items](#dropped-items).
- **Using it** (gameplay, `use.ts`, on `input.use.pressed` with an item in
  hand, see [Input](#input-action-duck-and-use)): gameplay clears
  `state.carriedItem` and emits `itemUsed {item, action}`, then by item
  (`actionOf(item, kidMode)`):
  - `beer` (Maßkrug, `drink`, never in kid mode; a beer carried in kid mode
    is eaten): `state.drunkTimer = DRUNK_DURATION` (6 s) and `drunkStart
    {duration}`; core delays the input ([Drunk input](#drunk-input)), the
    player and ui sway, and the spawner plans only easy patterns
    ([Drunk planning](#drunk-planning)). Gameplay counts the timer down every
    playing tick (`countDownDrunk`).
  - **Auto-drink** (`auto-drink.ts`, Wave 5c): a Maßkrug still in hand after
    `BEER_AUTO_DRINK` (6 s of playing time) is drunk by itself, exactly like a
    use press (same `itemUsed` / `drunkStart`), so carrying beer never stays a
    free pass for easy streets. Only a Maßkrug that would be drunk counts
    (never in kid mode); catching or using an item restarts the clock, a crash
    or a new run resets it.
  - `pretzel` / `gingerbread` (`eat`): +1 health and `healthGained {health}`;
    at full health `EAT_BONUS_POINTS` (150, times the multiplier) instead.
  - `football` (`throw`, `ball.ts`): a `ball` entity leaves the hands
    forward in a flat arc (`ballThrown`). Reaching a person knocks them over
    like a stomp (`knockOver`), scores `BALL_HIT_POINTS` (150, times the
    multiplier) and emits `ballHit`. A miss that lands draws
    `RICOCHET_CHANCE` (0.5) from `ctx.rng` (always drawn, so the rng sequence
    does not depend on the street) and ricochets back (`ballBack`) only when
    the street is free: no obstacle or rail within `RICOCHET_ROOM_SECONDS`
    (1 s of riding) on both sides of where it meets the skater
    (`ricochetRoom(ballX, speed)`), and **never while drunk**
    (`drunkTimer > 0`). Otherwise it rolls away harmlessly. The ricochet hops
    low (one jump clears it) and crashes the skater (kind `'ball'`, -1
    health) unless he jumps over it or is invulnerable.
- **UI**: "Stomp!" on the stomp, then a big popup per item above the raised
  item (`ui/item-look.ts`): "Ball geschnappt!", "Brezel!",
  "Prost!", "Lebkuchenherz!"; kid mode never shows "Prost!". The player
  draws the carried item and the catch pose; audio plays its own sounds.
- **Solver**: `new Solver(course, pace, {stomps: true})` treats a head
  landing as a valid path with the bounce (bit mask of stomped movers per
  node); the spawner verifies patterns without stomps, so no pattern ever
  requires one. `planStomp(state)` (`testing.ts`) finds a real stomp jump for
  tests and playtests: the middle of the widest run of take-off ticks (one
  hold) that stomp, so a take-off a few ticks off still stomps.
- **Stomp tooling** (`gameplay/stomp-bot.ts`, Vitest only): `stompWindow` /
  `tryStomp` measure the window for a scene (one walking or swaying person at
  a pinned speed, played by the real player + gameplay), `humanStomp` aims at
  the head with up to `jitter` ticks of error, and `rideStomping(seed,
  seconds, from)` lets a HumanBot that goes for every person ride a real run
  and reports stomps and crashes on the bounce.

### Dropped items

ROADMAP 19, gameplay `drop.ts` (`DroppedItems`, DOM-free) with the art in
`item-art.ts` (`drawDrops`, entities layer, after obstacles and people,
before stars):

- **Drop**: on `ballHit` the hit person lets go of their item (`itemOf`, as
  for a stomp: fan a football, Wasen visitor a Brezel or a Maßkrug; kid mode
  a Lebkuchenherz instead of the Maßkrug, so kid mode never drops beer). It
  falls from the hand in a short arc (up first, `DROP_TIME` 0.4 s) onto the
  street and lies there (`ITEM_BOX` 7 px box resting on `GROUND_Y`, with a
  small shadow and a glint), scrolling with the street. Items past the left
  edge are gone; a new run clears them.
- **Fair spot only**: the item comes to lie at the first of `DROP_SPOTS`
  (+12, +24, +36, -12, -24 px from the person's middle; + = further along
  the street) with `DROP_ROOM_SECONDS` (0.5 s of riding) of free street on
  both sides: no live obstacle or rail and no pattern still to come
  (`spawner.upcomingX()`). No free spot: nothing drops. Collecting it never
  needs a move, and the spawner and solver never see it.
- **Pickup**: every playing tick (not while the player is in the crash
  animation) the first item that overlaps `player.hitbox` is taken: on the
  ground by riding over it, in the air only while the feet are within the
  box (a low jump through it; a high jump passes over it and misses it).
  Gameplay then catches it exactly like a tossed item: `state.carriedItem`,
  `ITEM_POINTS` (200) and `itemCaught {item}`, so the ui shows the catch
  popup and the auto-drink clock of a picked-up Maßkrug starts at the pickup.
- **Replace**: a pickup always replaces what the skater carries (the newest
  item wins); the replaced item is gone.
- **Drunk planning**: a Maßkrug that drops lies within a few px of its
  visitor, so the patterns a quick drinker could reach after picking it up
  are already planned drunk-safe (`BEER_REACH` after a visitor holding a
  Maßkrug, see [Drunk planning](#drunk-planning)).
- Tests: `gameplay/drop.test.ts`; playtest `scripts/scenarios/drop.ts`.

## Human margins (fairness.ts)

The solver proves a pattern clearable with frame-perfect input. The spawner
also guarantees what a human can hit (`gameplay/fairness.ts`), for **every**
pattern:

- **Take-off window**: every take-off on the way (the first one and each one
  after a landing, also across the boundary to the previous pattern) has a
  window of at least `takeoffWindowAt(street)` consecutive working ticks with
  one of `HUMAN_HOLDS` (3/10/20), at every pace checked, including the chill
  jump at chill speeds (`Solver.takeoffWindow`, `humanFair`). The window is
  `EARLY_TAKEOFF_WINDOW` = 14 ticks (+-6 ticks of human timing) while the
  street distance is below `EARLY_WINDOW_DISTANCE` = 9500 (~90 s, while the
  player is still learning), then `LATE_TAKEOFF_WINDOW` = 12 (+-5 ticks). The
  window only counts jumps that land on free street (or a rail), so it also
  keeps landing room. Where that is impossible (chilled at the slowest
  speeds) the planner rerolls.
- **Across pattern boundaries**: the spawner passes the previous pattern's
  pieces (`PlanOptions.before`, shifted by its length plus the gap) and the
  combined course must be clearable at every pace, with real people motion.
- **Lead and runout** (`patterns.ts`): every pattern starts with
  `leadFor(speed)` = 20 + 0.3 x speed px of free run-up (plus
  `DRUNK_LEAD_SECONDS` while maybe drunk) and ends with `runoutFor(speed)` =
  32 + 0.55 x speed px in which the skater must be back on the ground, so a
  late landing still lands on free street (sized for `TOP_SPEED` 190).
- **Drunk**: see [Drunk planning](#drunk-planning).

### Drunk planning

The spawner treats a pattern as possibly ridden drunk (`SpawnSituation.drunk`)
while `state.drunkTimer > 0`, a Maßkrug is in hand or flying there, or the
pattern starts within `BEER_REACH` (`VIEW_MAX_W + SPAWN_MARGIN + 100` px of
street) after a Wasen visitor holding a Maßkrug (a quick drinker could catch
and drink it). Such patterns:

- come only from `DRUNK_TEMPLATES` (`single` and `pair`: lone or paired
  ground obstacles; no people, nothing overhead, no rails and no empty star
  patterns, so a drunk street still has something to jump; `fairness.ts`);
- get a longer free run-up before the first piece: `DRUNK_LEAD_SECONDS`
  (0.4 s of riding) on top of the normal lead (`patterns.ts` `leadFor`),
  because late, full drunk jumps take off far before the piece;
- must stay human-fair for the worst-case drunk input
  (`drunkFairness(window)` → `Margin {window, holds, spread}`): the take-off
  window grows by `drunkWindow`'s `pressMax - pressMin` (12 ticks: 24 instead
  of 12, 26 instead of 14), the only hold is `DRUNK_HOLD` (42 ticks: so long
  that even the shortest drunk outcome, `drunkWindow(DRUNK_HOLD).holdMin` =
  20, is still a full press, `FULL_PRESS`), and every hold may come out
  `spread` = `holdMax - DRUNK_HOLD` (22) ticks shorter or longer. A player
  who knows hold lengths are a lottery holds on and always gets the full
  jump; stars in drunk patterns mark that full jump;
- replace sober plans: when the situation turns drunk, patterns planned ahead
  but not yet on the street are thrown away and planned again (the rng stays
  where it is, so runs still replay).

### Effect street

ROADMAP 26 (Wave 9): during a drunk or chill phase the street never goes
empty, there is always something easy to jump (`spawner.ts`, `patterns.ts`).
A pattern counts as ridden under an effect while the player may be drunk
(see above) or is chilled (it starts before `chilledUntil` = the joint
pattern's end plus `chillStreet(fast)`, the street the slowed effect lasts).
Such patterns:

- never are an empty star pattern (`PlanOptions.effect`);
- while chilled come only up to `CHILLED_TIER` (1: lone pieces and pairs,
  no combos);
- are followed by a shorter gap (`effectGap`): just enough for
  `EFFECT_FREE_SECONDS` (1.1 s of riding at the fastest speed) of free street
  after the last obstacle or rail, never more than the normal `gapAt`;
- fall back to a lone low obstacle (`EFFECT_FALLBACK`: curb gap, then bench,
  pushed out by `EFFECT_PUSH_SECONDS` 0 / 0.5 / 1 s of riding until it is
  fair after the previous pattern) when nothing fair is found, instead of
  empty street.

No joint comes while the player may be drunk: it waits until sober. Test
tooling `effect-street.ts` `rideEffect(seed, from, 'drunk' | 'chill')` rides
a phase and reports its longest empty stretch (`effect-street.test.ts`).

## Planning budget

Planning a pattern (solver + human-fairness checks) can cost tens of
milliseconds, so the live game never plans a whole pattern in one tick:

- `PLAN_WORK_PER_TICK` = 400 solver units per tick (one unit = one simulated
  tick; ~0.4 ms on a desktop, ~1 ms on a phone at 4x CPU throttling). A
  pattern takes about 10 000 units (a drunk one about 25 000), the street
  needs about 100 per tick on average. The solver is resumable: when the shared
  `WorkBudget` runs out it throws `OUT_OF_WORK` and the next tick continues
  where it stopped (`patterns.ts` `planSteps` is a generator).
- **Plan ahead:** up to `PLAN_AHEAD` = 3 patterns are planned ahead of the
  one due next, so plans are usually ready long before they reach the edge,
  and the small budget catches up after drunk replans.
- **Late plan = empty street:** if a pattern is due while its plan is still
  running, empty street comes first (up to `PLAN_DELAY_MAX` = 160 px), and
  only after that the plan is finished at once. The speed range a pattern is
  checked for includes that delay.
- Units are deterministic, so runs replay exactly. Without `workPerTick`
  (unit tests, `new Spawner(zoneAt)`) every pattern is planned when due.

### Fair people

- **People come alone**: the `person` template (zones 1 and 2 only) holds one
  person and nothing else; no other template picks people. With the pattern
  lead, runout and the gap between patterns there are >= `PERSON_ROOM_SECONDS`
  (1 s) of free street before and after every person, and a person never
  walks into another obstacle while visible (walking only carries them
  towards their anchor, from further right).
- Their take-off window is the same `takeoffWindowAt(street)` as above.
- **Acceptance**: `HumanBot` (`testing.ts`: take-off +-4 ticks, holds 3/10/20,
  ducking +-4 ticks) rides 20 seeds x 3 min (`human-bot-*.test.ts`,
  `human-run.ts`) without a crash into or within 1 s of a person.

## Combo patterns

ROADMAP 33: spawn templates that chain pieces the street already has into a
grind line, with guide stars. The line is optional: rails never crash, so
the street path only jumps the ground obstacles.

- **Templates** (`gameplay/combos.ts` `COMBO_TEMPLATES`, names in
  `COMBO_NAMES`): `pipeUp` (low pipe, hop up onto a long high handrail) and
  `pipeStairs` (three short rails rising like a staircase), tier 2;
  `railBenchRail` (grind, hop down onto the bench, hop up onto the next
  rail) and `benchHopRail` (bench grind, jump over a low obstacle onto a
  rail), tier 3. A template builds through the small `PieceBuilder`
  interface (`rng`, `lead`, `end`, `rail`, `obstacle`, `openGap`) that
  `patterns.ts`'s `Builder` implements; ground obstacles stand like an open
  pair (`openGap`), so a grind that rolls off early lands in between.
- **Planning** (`patterns.ts`): combos are templates marked `line`; they get
  the normal checks (solver, human take-off window, across the boundary)
  and in addition a grind on any of their pieces must lead on fairly
  (`grindsFair`). Never while chilled (tier 2 and up) or drunk
  (`fairness.ts` `DRUNK_TEMPLATES`).
- **Guide stars** (`gameplay/line-guide.ts`): `lineGuide(pieces, solverOn,
  step, margin)` follows the solver's human line jump by jump
  (`Solver.bestJump` with the human margin, up to 4 jumps): from the street
  onto a rail, from that rail onto the next; it collects the hitbox centres
  of the airborne arcs and a row on top of every ridden rail.
  `spreadStars(points, spacing, max)` spreads at most `max` stars over them
  (never at street level). Follow the stars and you ride the combo; ignore
  them and you ride the street.
- **`PlanOptions.template`**: `planPattern(rng, tier, paces, {template:
  name})` plans only that template, whatever the tier, zone and effect
  (unit tests and the debug hook; throws when the name is unknown).
- **Debug hook**: `window.__gameplay.pattern(name, x?, seed?)` lays a planned
  template (e.g. a combo) with its origin at screen x, see
  [docs/TESTING.md](TESTING.md). Tests: `gameplay/combos.test.ts`; playtest
  `scripts/scenarios/combos.ts`.

## Bench (ledge contract)

The bench is a ledge: its entity `y` (the backrest's top edge) is the grind
top. Rules in `gameplay/rules.ts`, shared by contacts and the solver:

- `landsOnLedge(feet, top)`: the feet come down onto the top edge anywhere
  from half a hitbox before its front corner (`LEDGE_FRONT_REACH` =
  `HITBOX_W / 2`, the body already reaches over it) to its **rear end**: that
  grinds (`grindStart`), the rear end included.
- `pastLedge(feetX, top)`: once the board (wheel contact x) is past the rear
  end, the skater got there over the top, so a remaining overlap of the body's
  rear with the bench box is never a crash (landing behind it, or rolling off
  its end).
- Only riding into its front or side while low crashes.

## Bin crash

- The bin's catalogue entry has `swallows: true` (`gameplay/catalogue.ts`).
  On a crash into it gameplay emits `crash {kind: 'bin'}` and then **removes
  the bin entity** at once (`contacts.ts`).
- The player (`player/bin.ts`, `bin-art.ts`, the `binCrash` timeline in
  `poses.ts`) dives head first into the bin and draws it around the skater
  from the crash on: legs and board sticking out, legs kicking, still rolling
  on the ground; after `BIN_POP_AT` (0.76 s) he pops out and lands back on the
  board within `CRASH_TIME`, while the bin tumbles away to the left and leaves
  with the street. The lid colour comes from the hit entity's `data.variant`
  if it is still in `state.entities` when `crash` is emitted.
- `player.state` stays `crash` and invulnerability is the same as for every
  crash. Details in `src/player/CONTRACT.md`.

## Grind trick

- While grinding a rail or the bench, holding down (duck: ↓ / S, a swipe down
  on touch) performs a trick: the **player** sets `player.grindTrick = true`
  for as long as down is held and the grind lasts, and draws the skater facing
  the player (front view, the only view with the moustache).
- The trick ends when down is released or the grind ends (jump off, rail end,
  crash). **Gameplay** reads `player.grindTrick`, scores the trick and emits
  `grindTrick {entityId, ticks, points}` when it ends while the skater is
  still on the rail or bench (`grind-trick.ts`: `GRIND_TRICK_POINTS` = 3 per
  tick, times the multiplier, on top of the grind points); the ui shows
  "Grind-Trick! +…" and audio plays a sound.
- Ducking on the ground is unchanged; a grind trick never ducks.
- **Hint** (ui, `ui/trick-hint.ts` `TrickHint`): while grinding, on the first
  `TRICK_HINT_GRINDS` (3) grinds of a run and until the player has scored a
  grind trick once ever (storage key `grindTrickSeen`, set on the first
  `grindTrick`), a small plate centred under the skater just below the riding
  line says "↓ = Trick!" (desktop, with a key cap) or "Wisch runter = Trick!"
  (touch). It hides while the trick is held and when the grind ends.

## Chill effect (joint pickup)

Contract between gameplay, player and ui:

- **Gameplay** spawns the rare `joint` entity (never in the first 30 s,
  `JOINT_FIRST_DISTANCE` 3300 px; then every `JOINT_SPACING` 8600 px plus up
  to `JOINT_JITTER` 2400 px of street, at least 45 s even at `TOP_SPEED`;
  never while the player may be drunk, see [Effect street](#effect-street)). Touching it sets `state.chillTimer = CHILL_DURATION`
  (6 s, `core/chill.ts`) and emits `chillStart {entityId, duration}`. Gameplay
  counts the timer down every playing tick (before it sets the speed) and the
  speed becomes `speedAt(distance) * chillSpeedFactor(chillTimer)`: it eases to
  60 % over `CHILL_EASE_IN` (0.5 s) and back to normal over the last
  `CHILL_EASE_OUT` (1 s) of the timer. While `ctx.speedOverride` is set the
  speed stays pinned (only the timer runs).
- **Player** (`src/player`): while `state.chillTimer > 0` at the start of a
  tick, take-off velocity is `JUMP_VELOCITY * CHILL_JUMP_SCALE` (0.8,
  `player/tuning.ts`); gravity, hold gravity, max hold, coyote and buffer are
  unchanged. Look: red eyes and a smoking joint in the mouth.
- **Gameplay's jumpsim** applies the same scale (`stepBody(..., jumpScale)`),
  checked tick by tick against the real player. The spawner verifies every
  pattern the effect can reach (street up to `CHILL_REACH` after the joint)
  with the chill jump at chill speed, mid-ramp and full speed, besides the
  normal check.
- **UI** shows a warm, steady screen tint scaled by `chillStrength(timer)`
  and a draining timer bar with a joint icon in the HUD plate (kid mode: the
  bubble-gum look, see [Settings menu and kid mode](#settings-menu-and-kid-mode)).

## Stunt lines

ROADMAP 27 (Stunt Waves A and B): optional bonus lines that make runs more
fun, **not harder**.

- **Kinds** (`StuntKind`, part of `EntityKind`): `kicker`, a small ramp on
  the street that launches the skater high when the player presses jump on it (see
  [Manual ramp jump](#manual-ramp-jump-roadmap-40)); `ledge`, a slim
  grindable structure of the upper level 40-60 px above the street (railing,
  ledge, thin roof edge), drawn per zone (`gameplay/stunt-art.ts`). A
  ledge's entity `y` is its grind surface (like the bench, see
  [Bench](#bench-ledge-contract)). Line pieces carry `data.line` (the line's
  id), `data.step` (1..steps) and `data.steps`; a kicker carries its launch
  speed in `data.velocity` (`launchVelocityFor(ledge height)`).
- **Lines** (`gameplay/stunt-line.ts`): a designed line is one spawn pattern
  of 3-6 pieces: a kicker launches onto a ledge, gap jumps go from ledge to
  ledge, drops roll back onto the street onto the next kicker, with a star
  trail. The street holds nothing but the kickers, so the path below is
  always free. Each launch comes down onto its ledge at every speed and tick
  phase; each gap has a human take-off window of at least
  `STUNT_TAKEOFF_WINDOW` (16) ticks; jump arcs stay under `STUNT_APEX_MAX`
  (all checked with `stunt-sim.ts`). The spawner brings one line every
  `STUNT_LINE_INTERVAL` (30-45) s of riding, the first after
  `STUNT_FIRST_SECONDS` (25), none while drunk or chilled.
- **Runtime** (`gameplay/stunts.ts` `StuntLines`): a piece is *made* when a
  kicker launches the skater (after a press in its window) or a ledge is
  ground. The first piece made
  starts an attempt quietly (its points, no `stuntStep`, so there is never a
  "Combo x1!"); every further piece in order emits `stuntStep` with the line
  multiplier = pieces made (x2, x3 ..., up to `STUNT_MAX_MULTIPLIER` 6) and
  scores `STUNT_POINTS` (kicker 50, ledge 100) times it. Every started
  attempt ends exactly once with `stuntEnd`: completed (bonus
  `STUNT_LINE_BONUS` 150 per made piece) when the skater leaves the last
  piece with at least 2 made; else incomplete without bonus (street landing
  before a ledge, a kicker jumped over, a piece out of order, a crash).
  Stunt points are not multiplied by `state.multiplier`; the normal combo
  goes on around the line.
- **Events**: `launch {entityId, velocity}` (only after a jump press in the
  kicker's window; the player takes off on the next tick with `velocity`, no
  hold, like the stomp bounce; jumpsim mirrors it), `stuntStep {step, steps, multiplier, points}`, `stuntEnd {steps,
  made, completed, points}`. See [Events](#events-gameevents).
- **Design rules**: the camera never moves; the upper level is slim and
  covers little background; falling off or missing a piece never crashes or
  costs health (the skater lands on the street, the line ends); generous
  timing; kid mode works the same.
- **Ownership**: gameplay spawns the lines, detects kicker and ledge
  contacts, scores them and emits the events (art in `gameplay/art.ts` /
  `stunt-art.ts`); the player takes off on `launch` and shows the grab pose
  and hard landing (`GRAB_HEIGHT`, `HARD_LANDING_IMPACT` in
  `player/tuning.ts`); the ui shows "Combo xN!" and "Stunt-Linie! +…"
  (`ui/stunt-callout.ts`, top strip between the HUD plate and the buttons)
  and the ramp hint "Auf der Rampe springen! (Leertaste)" / "Auf der Rampe
  tippen!" around each kicker until a few ramp launches were done
  (`ui/kicker-hint.ts`, storage key `rampLaunches`); audio plays `launch`, a rising `stuntStep`
  and `stuntFanfare` / `stuntFizzle`. Debug hook
  `window.__gameplay.place('kicker' | 'ledge', x)`, `stuntLine(x)`,
  `stunts()`; playtest `scripts/scenarios/stunts.ts`.

### Manual ramp jump (ROADMAP 40)

Kickers never launch by themselves: the player presses jump on the ramp.

- **Launch window** (gameplay, per kicker): a jump press counts from
  shortly before the ramp's foot, while the feet are on the ramp, until
  shortly after its lip. Generous on purpose: a press a little early or
  late still launches. Gameplay then emits `launch {entityId, velocity}`
  with the kicker's launch speed (`data.velocity`, `launchVelocityFor`).
- **The replaced ollie**: the press that lands in the window usually starts
  a normal ollie first (the player jumps on every press). That ollie is
  replaced by the launch on the next tick: from the street the player takes
  off with `velocity`; already in the air it uses the speed that tops out
  where a launch from the street would (no double jump, no lost height; see
  "Kicker launch" in `src/player/CONTRACT.md`). The ollie's hold boost ends.
- **No press: roll over.** Without a press in the window the skater just
  rolls over the kicker: no `launch`, never a crash, no health lost. The
  board rests on the lip and drops off like off a curb (looks only, `y`
  stays `GROUND_Y`, no `land` event). A rolled-over first kicker starts no
  line; a running line whose next kicker passes without a launch ends
  incomplete (as for a kicker jumped over).
- **Fairness and bots**: the line checks (`stunt-sim.ts`) and the gameplay
  bots (`gameplay/testing.ts`, `stunt-bot.ts`) account for the press: they
  press in the window, and a launch still comes down onto its ledge at every
  speed and tick phase.
- **Hint**: the ramp hint (`ui/kicker-hint.ts`) tells the player to jump on
  the ramp ("Auf der Rampe springen! (Leertaste)" / "Auf der Rampe tippen!").
- **Playtest**: `scripts/scenarios/stunts.ts` presses with the real input of
  the viewport (`jumpOnRamp` / `tapJump` in `scripts/playtest-lib.ts`, Space
  or a one-finger tap) and checks that a kicker ridden over without a press
  does not launch; `scripts/scenarios/nordiy.ts` presses on every bank.

### Air trick

Stunt Wave B: a kickflip in the air that never changes the jump; ROADMAP 41
makes spamming it not pay and a late flip a risk.

- **Input**: a duck **press** in the air: ↓ / S on the keyboard; on touch
  a swipe down or, with one finger, the held jump finger dragged down (see
  [Kickflip drag](#kickflip-drag)).
- **Player** (`player/air-trick.ts`, `src/player/CONTRACT.md` "Air trick"),
  two kinds by the flight (`canStartAirTrick(y, vy, launched)`,
  `airTrickTicks(launched)`):
  - **launch kickflip** (in the air after a kicker launch): starts when the
    remaining air time (`airTicksLeft`) lets the `AIR_TRICK_TICKS` (21)
    ticks finish before the landing tick, so it never lands turning;
  - **street kickflip** (any other jump): starts from `AIR_TRICK_HEIGHT`
    (20 px) above the street (a tap hop never gets there), however little
    air is left, and runs the quicker `STREET_AIR_TRICK_TICKS` (12). One
    still running at touch-down ends on the landing tick, and `land`
    reports the ticks it still needed as `flipLeft` (0 without a flip).
    Started early on a full or medium jump (e.g. at the apex) it finishes;
    started late in the fall it lands turning.
  `player.airTrick` is true while it runs; a rail or ledge catch or a crash
  cuts it short. Physics and hitbox are unchanged; down in the air never
  ducks. A `crash` of kind `'bail'` throws the skater off like any crash.
- **Gameplay** (`gameplay/air-trick.ts` `AirTrickScore`) only reads
  `player.airTrick` (it never gates the trick): an ended trick waits for the
  next clean touchdown (`land` or `grindStart`) and then emits `airTrick
  {ticks, points, full}` once. Points = `round(base * share) *
  multiplier`, the best multiplier seen (the combo, or a running line's
  multiplier when higher). It is no line piece: no `stuntStep`, never ends a
  line.
  - **Base, a reason to flip**: `AIR_TRICK_POINTS` (150) when a `launch`
    came since the last touchdown (a launch kickflip always gets its full
    base); a street kickflip gets `STREET_AIR_TRICK_POINTS` (100) only when
    the same flight (from its `jump` to the touchdown) cleared an obstacle
    or stomped someone (`obstacleCleared` / `stomp`), else the small
    `EMPTY_AIR_TRICK_POINTS` (20).
  - **Repetition fade** (`gameplay/flip-fade.ts` `KickflipFade`): paid
    kickflips in a row get the share `KICKFLIP_FADE` [1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1] of
    their base (100 %, 50 %, 25 %, then 10 % for every later one). The next
    one is full again after a refresh: an obstacle cleared or a stomp, a
    grind start (rail, bench, ledge), a kicker `launch`, a `highFive`, or
    `KICKFLIP_REFRESH_SECONDS` (3 s) of playing time without a kickflip
    running or waiting for its touchdown. A run start resets it.
  - `full` is false when the empty-air base or the fade cut the points.
  - **Bail** (`gameplay/bail.ts`): a `land` whose `flipLeft` is more than
    `KICKFLIP_BAIL_GRACE_TICKS` (3) drops the trick (no `airTrick`) and is a
    crash like on any obstacle (`health.ts` `hurt`: one health, combo broken,
    carried item lost; ignored while invulnerable): `crash {entityId: -1,
    kind: 'bail', health}`. A rail or ledge catch is no `land` and never
    bails. Any other crash drops the waiting trick too.
  Kid mode follows the same rules. Points only go down, so the server's
  plausibility check needs no change.
- **UI**: a full kickflip shows the big "Kickflip! +N" callout with a
  sparkle (`ui/stunt-callout.ts`, top strip); a reduced one (`full` false)
  only the plain popup "Kickflip +N" (`ui/popup-feed.ts`); a bail the popup
  "Zu spät geflippt!" instead of "Autsch!". Until the first kickflip ever
  (storage key `airTrickSeen`) a hint "In der Luft [↓] = Kickflip!" / "In
  der Luft runterwischen = Kickflip!" shows in the air after every kicker
  launch and once per run on the first full street jump
  (`STREET_HINT_HEIGHT` 24 px up), `ui/air-trick-hint.ts`. **Audio**:
  `airSpin` as it starts; on a full score `airTrick` (street) or the bigger
  `airTrickBig` (`points >=` 150, a launch kickflip), on a reduced one the
  plain `trick` sting (louder for more points); a bail clatters the board
  (`clatter`).
- **Playtest**: `scripts/scenarios/kickflip.ts` (street kickflips with real
  keys and the one-finger drag: full over an obstacle, fading into empty
  air, the late bail); `scripts/scenarios/stunts.ts` (a full kickflip after
  a kicker launch).

## NorDIY skatepark (ROADMAP 36)

Once per Bad Cannstatt visit the skater rides through NorDIY, a self-built
DIY skatepark about one screen wide. It is a safe spot with a guaranteed,
optional stunt line and a crowd that cheers. The contract is in
`src/types.ts` (`ParkKind`, `ParkPiece`, `ParkPlan`, `GameState.park`, the
events below).

- **Plan** (`state.park: ParkPlan | null`): `{start, end, pieces}` in run
  distances (`state.distance` values, view px): the park spans
  `[start, end)`; a distance `d` is at screen x `PLAYER_X + d -
  state.distance` (it reaches the skater when `state.distance` gets to it).
  Each `ParkPiece {kind, from, to, height}` is one structure of the line, in
  order:
  - `bank`: a concrete bank or quarter; gameplay lays a `kicker` over
    `[from, to)`, `height` its lip (like every kicker it launches only on a
    jump press in its window, ROADMAP 40);
  - `container`: a shipping container whose roof edge is a `ledge`
    `height` px above the street;
  - `crane`: the self-built crane whose boom is the highest `ledge` (with a
    bonus star); its tower stands behind `from`.
  Gameplay places the stunt entity exactly over the piece and draws it
  plainly or not at all; the world draws the structure so its top edge is
  that surface.
- **Ownership of `state.park`**: **gameplay writes it** (set once per
  Bad Cannstatt visit well before `start` comes on screen, cleared after
  `end` has passed; core sets null, `resetRun` clears it). **World, audio
  and ui only read it**:
  - world draws the scenery on its street-speed layer over the span
    (containers with the wooden "NorDIY" sign, the crane, banks, the ramp
    under construction, the crowd, string lights) exactly under `pieces`,
    keeps traffic off there, and animates the crowd by `sessionCheer`;
  - audio places the boombox loop (fades in on approach, out behind the
    skater, respects mute and ducking) and the park sounds by it, and scales
    the cheers by `sessionCheer.level`;
  - ui shows the high five popup and the "Session! +…" callout.
- **Safe spot** (gameplay): no traffic and no crash obstacles inside the
  park, the speed ramp pauses while passing; the line follows the
  [stunt line](#stunt-lines) rules (optional, never crashes).
- **High fiver** (`ParkKind` `'highFiver'`, an `EntityKind`): a skater at
  the street edge raising a hand. Never an obstacle and never a crash.
  Gameplay draws it (`gameplay/park-art.ts`, via `art.ts`), with a slap
  pose after the high five (`data.slapped`).
- **Use routing priority** (`gameplay/high-five.ts`, asked first by
  `use.ts`): inside a `highFiver`'s high five window (its middle within
  `HIGH_FIVE_REACH` 24 px of the skater, either side, on the ground or in
  the air) the use press (E, `commands.useItem()` / the item button, test hook
  `input.use()`) goes to the high five: gameplay emits `highFive {entityId,
  points}` and the carried item is **not** used (no `itemUsed`). Outside the
  window the press uses the item as before.
- **Session**: every grind trick, air trick and combo step inside the park
  emits `sessionCheer {level}` (`level` 0..1, the cheering so far); when the
  skater leaves the park gameplay emits `sessionEnd {level, points}` with
  the "Session!" bonus scaled by the cheering (0 if none).
- **Kid mode**: the crowd drinks lemonade instead of beer; no alcohol or
  drug references in art, texts or sounds. The sign is the same.
- **Line** (`gameplay/park-line.ts`, spawn pattern `park`): high fiver ->
  bank -> container -> (gap jump | drop + bank) -> container -> (gap jump up
  | drop + bank) -> crane boom; `parkPiecesOf` turns the pattern into the
  plan's pieces.
- Playtest: `scripts/scenarios/nordiy.ts` (debug hook
  `window.__gameplay.park(offset?, seed?)` plans a ridable park right ahead;
  `window.__world.planPark(x?)` shows the scenery only; see
  docs/TESTING.md).

## How state flows

```
DOM events -> core/input -> ActionButton latches (action/duck via DelayedButton while drunk) -> Game.tick():
   InputFrame -> systems.update (world, player, gameplay, audio, ui) -> core integrate / mode
   events emitted along the way are delivered synchronously to subscribers
requestAnimationFrame -> FixedTimestep (0..n ticks) -> Game.render(layers) -> Renderer.present
```

Persistence: `import { store } from '../core/storage'`. Keys are namespaced
`cannstatt-cruiser:*`. Use `highscore`, `starsTotal`, `kidMode` and
`itemHintSeen` (ui; the first-catch touch hint was shown), `muted`
(audio), and `lastSeenVersion`, `visits`, `installHintDismissed` (core; the
ui changes them only through `commands`). Calls never throw.
